# Brain_Tumor_Detection_ML

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain tumors from MRI scans as a clinical decision-support tool. Multiple models were evaluated, including an SVM baseline and three CNN architectures of increasing complexity, on a cleaned multi-source dataset of over 11,000 images across four classes. A robust preprocessing pipeline—covering deduplication, normalization, resizing, and light augmentation—was crucial to prevent data leakage and ensure reliable learning. The best-performing advanced CNN achieved a macro F1-score of 0.98, demonstrating strong generalization compared to simpler models. Despite high accuracy, the project highlights key limitations for real-world deployment, including lack of patient-level metadata and explainability, emphasizing the importance of Responsible AI in medical applications.
