# Brain_Tumor_Detection_ML

This repository presents an end-to-end ML pipeline for brain tumor classification from MRI images, comparing classical and deep learning models. It emphasizes robust preprocessing, data quality, and generalization, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy, overfitting, and computational cost in high-stakes medical imaging.
